# dataviz_challenge

This program takes data for experimental tumor treatments on mice and creates various visualizations to interpret the data. Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy and matplotlib are utilized.

-The data is imported and refined, eliminating any duplicated entries.

-Key statistical metrics are computed for each drug treatment.

-Graphical illustrations showcase the distribution of gender ratios, tumor size across treatment groups, and the evolution of tumor size during the treatment period for specific mice.

-A scatter plot effectively demonstrates the positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor size.

-Regression analysis is employed to establish a linear model equation relating weight and tumor size, offering a predictive tool for future applications.
